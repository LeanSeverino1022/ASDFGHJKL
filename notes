Shortcut for ready event method on document object

$(function () {
    //script here. Any statements inside the method automatically run when the page has loaded.
});


jQuery provides a method .on() to respond to any event on the selected elements. 
This is called an event binding. Although .on() isn't the only method provided for event binding, 
it is a best practice to use this for jQuery 1.7+.

You can use .on() to bind a function to multiple events:

$('#element').on('keyup keypress blur change', function(e) {
    // e.type is the type of event fired
});

PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION throws PDOException. In my opinion this is the mode you should use. It acts very much like or die(mysql_error()); when it isn't caught, but unlike or die() the PDOException can be caught and handled gracefully if you choose to do so. src: http://wiki.hashphp.org/PDO_Tutorial_for_MySQL_Developers
